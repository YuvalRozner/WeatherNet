    label: "What is WeatherNet?",
    description: `The WeatherNet system consists of two primary components:
      \n\bThe backend:\b responsible for data processing, ML model training, and predictions.
      \bThe frontend:\b a user-friendly website for accessing forecasts.\n`,

    label: "Our Approach to Weather Forecasting",
    description: `Unlike traditional weather prediction models that rely on physics-based equations and statistical methods, WeatherNet harnesses the power of machine learning.
    \nWe collect real-time and historical weather data from the Israel Meteorological Service (IMS) across multiple stations, feeding it into our ML model to generate precise temperature forecasts for the coming days.\n`,

  {
    label: "The ML Architecture",
    description: `We designed an architecture that first processes data through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), where each feature is filtered independently.
    The output then transitions into a transformer phase, leveraging attention mechanisms to account for both temporal dependencies and geographical positioning.
    \nTo learn more about our architecture and how it enhances weather prediction, visit the 'Architecture' page.\n`,

    label: "Accuracy & Performance",
    description: `WeatherNet has achieved high forecasting accuracy, with an error margin of less than 1.5Â°C for the majority of the data.
    \nWe trained four models with the same architecture structure, each specialized for a different forecast period: 0-12 hours, 12-24 hours, 24-36 hours, and 36-60 hours.
    \nLearn more about our performance metrics and comparisons with traditional forecasting models on our dedicated pages.\n`,

    label: "Project Workflow",
    description: `WeatherNet was originally developed as a final-year project by Yuval Rozner and Dor Shabat during Our Software Engineering degree. The project evolved through a structured workflow across two semesters.
    \nIn the first semester, we focused on learning the necessary subjects, conducting deep research on relevant topics, and establishing a connection with the Israel Meteorological Service (IMS). We developed a proof-of-concept mini-system to validate our approach and published our Phase A paper.
    \nDuring the second semester, we refined our approach by processing vast amounts of data, building our model, and fine-tuning hyperparameters for improved accuracy. Additionally, we developed the user interface and integrated the backend prediction module with the WeatherNet website. Finally, we successfully deployed a live version of WeatherNet, published our Phase B paper, and released both the User Manual and Developer Manual.\n`,
