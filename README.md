## Weather Forecasting Using ML

WeatherNet aims to develop an advanced machine learning model to predict weather conditions using historical weather data. Leveraging high-resolution data from Meteomatics, we seek to enhance the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasts.

## Objectives

- Collect and preprocess historical weather data from Meteomatics.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations.
- Research and evaluate various machine learning algorithms for weather prediction.
- Develop and validate initial models to identify the most promising approaches.
- Document findings and methodologies for future development phases.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Research and Initial Development (First Semester)

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather and clean data using Python and Pandas.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Algorithm Research**: Investigate suitable machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forests, and LSTM.
- **Model Development**: Create and evaluate initial models with cross-validation.
- **Documentation**: Record research findings and methodologies.

## Expected Achievements (First Semester)

- Comprehensive dataset and detailed exploratory data analysis.
- Initial machine learning models developed and evaluated.
- Identification of the most promising algorithms for accurate weather prediction.
- Documentation of research findings to guide further development.
